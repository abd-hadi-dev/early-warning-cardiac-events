# early-warning-cardiac-events
AI/ML Internship Project - Data Cleaning for Heart Risk Prediction

This project is part of my AI/ML internship. The goal is to clean and prepare health data for predicting cardiac events using machine learning.

## 📁 Files Included
- `heart_cleaning.ipynb`: Notebook with step-by-step data preprocessing
- `data/heart_raw.csv`: Original raw dataset
- `data/heart_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned and normalized dataset

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing & scaling)

## 📊 Techniques Covered
- Handling missing and invalid values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Outlier detection

## 🎯 Prediction Target
- `RiskOfUpcomingCardiacEvent` — 1 = High Risk, 0 = Low Risk

## ✅ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Visualized distributions with histograms and boxplots
- Explored feature relationships using a correlation matrix and pairplot
- Compared key features (heart rate, BP, cholesterol) across cardiac event groups
- Included an optional interactive Plotly chart
- Gained early insights for feature importance and risk prediction
